📌 Project Title

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

📝 Description

This project implements the Caesar Cipher, a classical encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a user-defined shift value.

⚙️ Features

Encrypts plaintext using Caesar Cipher

Decrypts ciphertext back to original text

Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters

Preserves non-alphabetic characters (spaces, symbols, numbers)
